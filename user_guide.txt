‚ö†Ô∏è Possible Errors and How to Fix Them
1. Google Drive Folder Creation Fails
Reason: This usually happens due to an authorization issue.
Solution:

Delete the mycreds file in the project folder.

Then re-run the script to re-authorize access.

2. Page Contains Data but Requires Login
Sometimes the script may fail to find the required HTML element and stop with an error. This can happen if:

The page is asking for login and the script cannot access the data.

The script considers the URL invalid and skips it.

‚úÖ Solution 1 (if the script simply stopped):
Just re-run the script. It will continue from where it left off.

‚úÖ Solution 2 (if the script marked the URL as bad):
If you're sure the product exists on that URL, but it was marked as invalid (bad url), you‚Äôll need to manually reset its status in the database.

Steps:

Open the product_data.db file using DB Browser for SQLite.

Go to "Open Database" and select the product_data.db file located in the project directory.

Click the "Execute SQL" tab.

Run the following SQL command to reset the product‚Äôs status:

UPDATE product_data SET scraped_status = 0 WHERE product_url = 'paste_the_product_url_here';
Save the changes and close the database.

Re-run the script.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This step is rarely needed, because in most cases, the script fails gracefully when it can't find the required element.
